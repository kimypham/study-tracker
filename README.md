# Study Tracker
A productivity tool that uses the pomodoro method to keep track of time spent on certain tasks. I made this for VCE Software Development.

## What Study Tracker does
Study Tracker aims to help users stay organized and maximise their productivity based on the concept that individuals work more effectively in short bursts rather than in long sessions. By tracking time spent on tasks or subjects and encouraging the habit of taking breaks through the usage of a count up/count down timer, this prevents users from being overworked and increases their awareness about how they use their time to help them concentrate and develop better time management skills.
A report of the time tracked made by the software solution saves the individualâ€™s time by calculating and compiling these statistics automatically, allowing the user to analyze their statistics themselves if they wish.
