# Study Tracker

A productivity tool that uses the pomodoro method to keep track of time spent on certain tasks. I made this for VCE Software Development.

## What Study Tracker does
The project Study Tracker is a software solution that aims to provide a simple way to help users stay organized and maximise their productivity based on the concept that individuals work more effectively in short bursts rather than in long sessions. By tracking the time spent on tasks or subjects whilst encouraging the habit of taking breaks through the usage of a count up or count down timer, this prevents users from being overworked and increases their awareness about the time spent in order for the user to concentrate on the task at hand and to help them develop better time management skills.
	
As students are increasingly utilizing portable devices when studying, this solution provides a modern take on the traditional time tracking method, switching the physical timer and paper for a digital, automated version instead. A report of the time tracked made by the software solution also saves the individualâ€™s time by calculating and compiling these statistics automatically allowing the user to analyze their statistics themselves if they wish.


Through these features, the software solution will make studying more effective and efficient for users, meeting their needs, whilst remaining easy to understand and use.
